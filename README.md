# Palindrome Checker

This project is a Full Stack MERN application performing CRUD operations on messages that could be palindromes

## Assumptions

-   Palindrome definition followed:

> A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of alphanumeric characters which reads the same backward as forward

-   Emojis were permitted for entry but will always return false as they're not considered alphanumeric characters
-   An empty message is a valid palindrome

## Build Application

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd palindrome`
3. `cd frontend/ && npm i`
4. Go back to palindrome folder
5. `cd backend/ && npm i`
6. Go back to palindrome folder
7. `npm i`
8. `npm start`

### Running tests

Outside the frontend and backend folders just run `npm test`
